# Weekly Upstream Sync Agentic Workflow
This document describes the `weekly-upstream-sync.yml` GitHub Actions workflow, which automates the detection of new changes in the official [Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) and delegates the merge work to the Copilot coding agent.

## Overview

The workflow runs on a **weekly schedule** (every Monday at 10:00 UTC) and can also be triggered manually. It does **not** perform the actual merge — instead, it detects upstream changes and creates a GitHub issue assigned to `copilot`, which then follows the [agentic-merge-upstream](../prompts/agentic-merge-upstream.prompt.md) prompt to port the changes.

## Trigger

| Trigger | Schedule |
|---|---|
| `schedule` | Every Monday at 10:00 UTC (`0 10 * * 1`) |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual trigger from the Actions tab |

## Permissions

| Permission | Level | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `contents` | `write` | Read `.lastmerge` file |
| `issues` | `write` | Create/close upstream-sync issues |
| `pull-requests` | `write` | Allow Copilot agent to create PRs |

## Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN` | PAT used as `GH_TOKEN` for `gh` CLI operations (issue create/close/comment). Required because the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot assign issues to `copilot-swe-agent`. |

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Checkout repository

Checks out the repo to read the `.lastmerge` file, which contains the SHA of the last upstream commit that was merged into the Java SDK.

### 2. Check for upstream changes

- Reads the last merged commit hash from `.lastmerge`
- Clones the upstream `github/copilot-sdk` repository
- Compares `.lastmerge` against upstream `HEAD`
- If they match: sets `has_changes=false`
- If they differ: counts new commits, generates a summary (up to 20 most recent), and sets outputs (`commit_count`, `upstream_head`, `last_merge`, `summary`)

### 3. Close previous upstream-sync issues (when changes found)

**Condition:** `has_changes == true`

Before creating a new issue, closes any existing open issues with the `upstream-sync` label. This prevents stale issues from accumulating when previous sync attempts were incomplete or superseded. Each closed issue receives a comment explaining it was superseded.

### 4. Close stale upstream-sync issues (when no changes found)

**Condition:** `has_changes == false`

If the upstream is already up to date, closes any lingering open `upstream-sync` issues with a comment noting that no changes were detected. This handles the case where a previous issue was created but the changes were merged manually (updating `.lastmerge`) before the agent completed.

### 5. Create issue and assign to Copilot

**Condition:** `has_changes == true`

Creates a new GitHub issue with:

- **Title:** `Upstream sync: N new commits (YYYY-MM-DD)`
- **Label:** `upstream-sync`
- **Assignee:** `copilot-swe-agent`
- **Body:** Contains commit count, commit range links, a summary of recent commits, and a link to the merge prompt

The Copilot coding agent picks up the issue, creates a branch and PR, then follows the merge prompt to port the changes.

### 6. Summary

Writes a GitHub Actions step summary with:

- Whether changes were detected
- Commit count and range
- Recent upstream commits
- Link to the created issue (if any)
