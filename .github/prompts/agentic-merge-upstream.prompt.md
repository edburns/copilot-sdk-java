# Merge Upstream SDK Changes

You are an expert Java developer tasked with porting changes from the official Copilot SDK (primarily the .NET implementation) to this Java SDK.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Java SDK Design Takes Priority

**The current design and architecture of the Java SDK is the priority.** When porting changes from upstream:

1. **Adapt, don't copy** - Translate upstream features to fit the Java SDK's existing patterns, naming conventions, and architecture
2. **Preserve Java idioms** - The Java SDK should feel natural to Java developers, not like a C# port
3. **Maintain consistency** - New code must match the existing codebase style and structure
4. **Evaluate before porting** - Not every upstream change needs to be ported; some may not be applicable or may conflict with Java SDK design decisions

Before making any changes, **read and understand the existing Java SDK implementation** to ensure new code integrates seamlessly.

## Workflow Overview

1. Create a new branch from main
2. Update Copilot CLI to latest version
3. Update README with minimum CLI version requirement
4. Clone upstream repository
5. Analyze diff since last merge
6. Apply changes to Java SDK (commit as you go)
7. Test and fix issues
8. Update documentation
9. Push branch to remote for Pull Request review

---

## Step 1: Create a New Branch

Before starting any work, create a new branch from `main` to isolate the merge changes:

```bash
# Ensure we're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch with a descriptive name including the date
BRANCH_NAME="merge-upstream-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
echo "Created branch: $BRANCH_NAME"
```

**Important:** All changes will be committed to this branch as you work. This allows for proper review via Pull Request.

## Step 2: Update Copilot CLI

Update the locally installed GitHub Copilot CLI to the latest version:

```bash
copilot update
```

After updating, capture the new version and update the README.md to reflect the minimum version requirement:

```bash
# Get the current version
CLI_VERSION=$(copilot --version | head -n 1 | awk '{print $NF}')
echo "Updated Copilot CLI to version: $CLI_VERSION"
```

Update the Requirements section in `README.md` to specify the minimum CLI version requirement. Locate the line mentioning "GitHub Copilot CLI installed" and update it to include the version information.

Commit this change before proceeding:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update Copilot CLI minimum version requirement to $CLI_VERSION"
```

## Step 3: Clone Upstream Repository

Clone the official Copilot SDK repository into a temporary folder:

```bash
UPSTREAM_REPO="https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk.git"
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
git clone --depth=100 "$UPSTREAM_REPO" "$TEMP_DIR/copilot-sdk"
```

## Step 4: Read Last Merge Commit

Read the commit hash from `.lastmerge` file in the Java SDK root:

```bash
LAST_MERGE_COMMIT=$(cat .lastmerge)
echo "Last merged commit: $LAST_MERGE_COMMIT"
```

## Step 5: Analyze Changes

Generate a diff between the last merged commit and HEAD of main:

```bash
cd "$TEMP_DIR/copilot-sdk"
git fetch origin main
git log --oneline "$LAST_MERGE_COMMIT"..origin/main
git diff "$LAST_MERGE_COMMIT"..origin/main --stat
```

Focus on analyzing:
- `dotnet/src/` - Primary reference implementation
- `dotnet/test/` - Test cases to port
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `sdk-protocol-version.json` - Protocol version changes

## Step 6: Identify Changes to Port

For each change in the upstream diff, determine:

1. **New Features**: New methods, classes, or capabilities added to the SDK
2. **Bug Fixes**: Corrections to existing functionality
3. **API Changes**: Changes to public interfaces or method signatures
4. **Protocol Updates**: Changes to the JSON-RPC protocol or message types
5. **Test Updates**: New or modified test cases

> **⚠️ Important:** When adding new documentation pages, always update `src/site/site.xml` to include them in the navigation menu.

## Step 7: Apply Changes to Java SDK

When porting changes:

### ⚠️ Priority: Preserve Java SDK Design

Before modifying any code:

1. **Read the existing Java implementation first** - Understand current patterns, class structure, and naming
2. **Identify the Java equivalent approach** - Don't replicate C# patterns; find the idiomatic Java way
3. **Check for existing abstractions** - The Java SDK may already have mechanisms that differ from .NET
4. **Preserve backward compatibility** - Existing API signatures should not break unless absolutely necessary
5. **When in doubt, match existing code** - Follow what's already in the Java SDK, not the upstream

### Commit Changes Incrementally

**Important:** Commit your changes as you work, grouping related changes together:

```bash
# After porting a feature or fix, commit with a descriptive message
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "Port <feature/fix name> from upstream"

# Example commits:
# git commit -m "Port new authentication flow from upstream"
# git commit -m "Add new message types from upstream protocol update"
# git commit -m "Port bug fix for session handling from upstream"
```

This creates a clear history of changes that can be reviewed in the Pull Request.

### General Guidelines

- **Naming Conventions**: Convert C# PascalCase to Java camelCase for methods/variables
- **Async Patterns**: C# `async/await` → Java `CompletableFuture` or synchronous equivalents
- **Nullable Types**: C# `?` nullable → Java `@Nullable` annotations or `Optional<T>`
- **Properties**: C# properties → Java getters/setters or records
- **Records**: C# records → Java records (Java 17+)
- **Events**: C# events → Java callbacks or listeners

### Type Mappings

| C# Type                | Java Equivalent              |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| `string`               | `String`                     |
| `int`                  | `int` / `Integer`            |
| `bool`                 | `boolean` / `Boolean`        |
| `Task<T>`              | `CompletableFuture<T>`       |
| `CancellationToken`    | (custom implementation)      |
| `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`  | `Stream<T>` or `Iterator<T>` |
| `JsonElement`          | `JsonNode` (Jackson)         |
| `Dictionary<K,V>`      | `Map<K,V>`                   |
| `List<T>`              | `List<T>`                    |

### Code Style

Follow the existing Java SDK patterns:
- Use Jackson for JSON serialization (`ObjectMapper`)
- Use Java records for DTOs where appropriate
- Follow the existing package structure under `com.github.copilot.sdk`
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- **Match the style of surrounding code** - Consistency with existing code is more important than upstream patterns
- **Prefer existing abstractions** - If the Java SDK already solves a problem differently than .NET, keep the Java approach

## Step 7.5: Port Tests

After porting implementation changes, **always check for new or updated tests** in the upstream repository:

### Check for New Tests

```bash
cd "$TEMP_DIR/copilot-sdk"
git diff "$LAST_MERGE_COMMIT"..origin/main --stat -- dotnet/test/
git diff "$LAST_MERGE_COMMIT"..origin/main --stat -- test/snapshots/
```

### Port Test Cases

For each new or modified test file in `dotnet/test/`:

1. **Create corresponding Java test class** in `src/test/java/com/github/copilot/sdk/`
2. **Follow existing test patterns** - Look at existing tests like `PermissionsTest.java` for structure
3. **Use the E2ETestContext** infrastructure for tests that need the test harness
4. **Match snapshot directory names** - Test snapshots in `test/snapshots/` must match the directory name used in `ctx.configureForTest()`

### Test File Mapping

| Upstream Test (.NET)        | Java SDK Test                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `dotnet/test/AskUserTests.cs`  | `src/test/java/com/github/copilot/sdk/AskUserTest.java`  |
| `dotnet/test/HooksTests.cs`    | `src/test/java/com/github/copilot/sdk/HooksTest.java`    |
| `dotnet/test/ClientTests.cs`   | `src/test/java/com/github/copilot/sdk/CopilotClientTest.java` |
| `dotnet/test/*Tests.cs`        | `src/test/java/com/github/copilot/sdk/*Test.java`        |

### Test Snapshot Compatibility

New test snapshots are stored in `test/snapshots/` in the upstream repository. These snapshots are automatically cloned during the Maven build process.

If tests fail with errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`, the test harness may not yet support the new RPC methods. In this case:

1. **Mark tests as `@Disabled`** with a clear reason (e.g., `@Disabled("Requires test harness update with X support - see upstream PR #NNN")`)
2. **Document the dependency** in the test class Javadoc
3. **Enable tests later** once the harness is updated

### Unit Tests vs E2E Tests

- **Unit tests** (like auth option validation) can run without the test harness
- **E2E tests** require the test harness with matching snapshots

Commit tests separately or together with their corresponding implementation changes.

## Step 8: Format and Run Tests

After applying changes, format the code and run the test suite:

```bash
mvn spotless:apply
mvn clean test
```

**Important:** Always run `mvn spotless:apply` before testing to ensure code formatting is consistent with project standards.

### If Tests Fail

1. Read the test output carefully
2. Identify the root cause (compilation error, runtime error, assertion failure)
3. Fix the issue in the Java code
4. Re-run tests
5. Repeat until all tests pass

### Common Issues

- **Missing imports**: Add required import statements
- **Type mismatches**: Ensure proper type conversions
- **Null handling**: Add null checks where C# had nullable types
- **JSON serialization**: Verify Jackson annotations are correct

## Step 9: Build the Package

Once tests pass, build the complete package:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Verify:
- No compilation errors
- No warnings (if possible)
- JAR file is generated in `target/`

## Step 10: Update Documentation

**Documentation is critical for new features.** Every new feature ported from upstream must be documented before the merge is complete.

### Documentation Checklist

For each new feature or significant change:

1. **README.md**: Update the main README if there are user-facing changes
2. **src/site/markdown/index.md**: Update if requirements or quick start examples change
3. **src/site/markdown/documentation.md**: Add sections for new basic usage patterns
4. **src/site/markdown/advanced.md**: Add sections for new advanced features (tools, handlers, configurations)
5. **src/site/markdown/mcp.md**: Update if MCP-related changes are made
6. **Javadoc**: Add/update Javadoc comments for all new/changed public APIs
7. **src/site/site.xml**: Update if new documentation pages were added

### Documentation Requirements for New Features

When adding a new feature, ensure the documentation includes:

- **What it does**: Clear explanation of the feature's purpose
- **How to use it**: Code example showing typical usage
- **API reference**: Link to relevant Javadoc
- **Configuration options**: All available settings/properties

### Example: Documenting a New Handler

If a new handler (like `UserInputHandler`, `PermissionHandler`) is added, create a section in `advanced.md`:

```markdown
## Feature Name

Brief description of what the feature does.

\`\`\`java
var session = client.createSession(
    new SessionConfig()
        .setOnFeatureRequest((request, invocation) -> {
            // Handle the request
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(result);
        })
).get();
\`\`\`

Explain the request/response objects and their properties.

See [FeatureHandler](apidocs/com/github/copilot/sdk/json/FeatureHandler.html) Javadoc for more details.
```

### Verify Documentation Consistency

Ensure consistency across all documentation files:

- Requirements section should match in `README.md` and `src/site/markdown/index.md`
- Code examples should use the same patterns and be tested
- Links to Javadoc should use correct paths (`apidocs/...`)

## Step 11: Update Last Merge Reference

Update the `.lastmerge` file with the new HEAD commit and commit this change:

```bash
cd "$TEMP_DIR/copilot-sdk"
NEW_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse origin/main)
cd -  # Return to Java SDK directory
echo "$NEW_COMMIT" > .lastmerge

# Commit the .lastmerge update
git add .lastmerge
git commit -m "Update .lastmerge to $NEW_COMMIT"
```

## Step 12: Push Branch and Create Pull Request

Push the branch to remote and create a Pull Request automatically:

```bash
# Push the branch to remote
git push -u origin "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

**After pushing, create the Pull Request using the GitHub MCP tool (`mcp_github_create_pull_request`).**

Use `owner: copilot-community-sdk`, `repo: copilot-sdk-java`, `head: $BRANCH_NAME`, `base: main`.

**After creating the PR, add the `upstream-sync` label** using the `gh` CLI:

```bash
gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label "upstream-sync"
```

The PR body should include:
1. **Title**: `Merge upstream SDK changes (YYYY-MM-DD)`
2. **Body** with:
   - Summary of upstream commits analyzed (with count and commit range)
   - Table of changes ported (commit hash + description)
   - List of changes intentionally not ported (with reasons)
   - Verification status (test count, build status)

### PR Body Template

```markdown
## Upstream Merge

Ports changes from the official Copilot SDK ([github/copilot-sdk](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk)) since last merge (`<OLD_COMMIT>`→`<NEW_COMMIT>`).

### Upstream commits analyzed (N commits)

- Brief description of each upstream change and whether it was ported or not

### Changes ported

| Commit | Description |
|---|---|
| `<hash>` | Description of change |

### Not ported (intentionally)

- **Feature name** — Reason why it wasn't ported

### Verification

- All **N tests pass** (`mvn clean test`)
- Package builds successfully (`mvn clean package -DskipTests`)
- Code formatted with Spotless
```

## Step 13: Final Review

Before finishing:

1. Run `git log --oneline main..$BRANCH_NAME` to review all commits
2. Run `git diff main..$BRANCH_NAME --stat` to see a summary of all changes
3. Ensure no unintended changes were made
4. Verify code follows project conventions
5. Confirm the branch was pushed to remote
6. Confirm the Pull Request was created and provide the PR URL to the user
