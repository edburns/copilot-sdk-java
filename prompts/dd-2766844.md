## Prompt

I am now the directly responsible individual for this repository.

Here is my current understanding of what this codebase is, and how it is maintained.

- This codebase is a Java "port" of the reference implementation of the GitHub Copilot SDK for .NET.

- It uses no Java language features beyond those in Java 17 LTS.

- It uses an agentic workflow to allow keeping the code in sync with the reference implementation in the `dotnet` directory of https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk .

   - This agentic workflow is described in `prompts/ops-readiness-report.md` in this codebase.
   
Analyze this codebase, this file, all files referenced from this file, and come up with a plan for me to quickly gain mastery of this codebase.

For example, the one time I tried to do the steps in the `Development Setup` section of the top level `README.md` I observed there were numerous failures. I would think being able to run the tests cleanly would be a good first step.
